# FE16-Angular-Day3
Basic
Basic Exercise | Warm up questions
* What is the difference between non-goals and anti-goals?

* Name at least 4 reasons (two from each of your pair), why MindMapping is especially good for group projects?

* Are Use Case Diagrams suited for planning details of software architecture?

* Name every part of the MoSCoW prioritization schema.


Basic Exercise
Write a short document with goals, non-goals and anti-goals for one of your past projects.
Expand the given Use Case Diagram from the preparatory material by another role and/or optional elements.

Intermediate Exercise

Choose a project from a previous class-day that you have not yet completed. Draw a Mind Map to illustrate your ideas and approaches for it. Tipp: If you create a digital MindMap, you can also push this file into its own repository on your GitHub account.
Create a MoSCoW prioritization list for one of your past projects (choose a different one than from the B. exercise example.)

Challenge
Find a partner to play the role of customer for a web development project you will be creating. Once they have informed you verbally about their wishes, user-stories and capabilities they want in their product, create a detailed Use Case Diagram of the project. When you are done (and not before), show it to your partner and compare, if it actually aligns with their intentions.
